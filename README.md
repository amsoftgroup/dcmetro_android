dcmetro_android: DC Metro arrival times

This Android application requires a developer API Key, freely obtainable from WMATA's website:

http://developer.wmata.com/

Once the key is obtained, place the String in the res/values/strings.xml file under the WMATA_KEY tag, replacing the text "[insert your key here]".
